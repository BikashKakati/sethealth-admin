## Folder Structure Guidelines

### Folder Naming Convention:
- All folders must be named in lowercase and separated by dashes (`-`).
- **Example**: `dashboard-pages`, `user-profile`, `api-services`

---

## File Naming Convention

### Components:
- Components should start with a capital letter and follow camel case naming.
- File extensions should be `.tsx` or `.ts` (for TypeScript).
- **Example**: `DashboardButtons.tsx`, `UserProfileForm.tsx`

### Utility Functions/Files:
- Utility files should be named in camel case and kept in a dedicated folder.
- **Example**: `formatDate.ts`, `apiRequestHandler.ts`
